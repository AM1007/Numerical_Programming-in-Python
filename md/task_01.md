# Topic 1. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

**Today, you will perform a spectral clustering task on the Iris dataset. You will load the data, analyze it, perform spectral clustering, and evaluate the results using a Confusion Matrix.**

This will help you strengthen the following skills:

- Working with the `sklearn` library for loading and processing data

- Using `seaborn` to visualize the distribution of data by class

- Applying data standardization methods to prepare the data for clustering

- Understanding and experimenting with spectral clustering parameters

- Evaluating results using a Confusion Matrix and visualizing the clustering

***

## Task (Step by Step)

**1. Load and Create a DataFrame:** Use the `pandas` library to create and work with a DataFrame. The data can be loaded using `load_iris()` from the `sklearn` library.

**2. Obtain Basic Statistical Characteristics:** Use the `describe()` function from the `pandas` library to get statistical characteristics of the data.

**3. Visualize the Distribution of Observations by Class:** Use the `seaborn` library to plot the distribution.

**4. Standardize the Data:** Use the `sklearn.preprocessing` library to standardize the data.

**5. Perform Spectral Clustering:** Use the `sklearn.cluster` library to perform spectral clustering.

**6. Compare Predicted Clusters with Actual Classes:** Use the `confusion_matrix()` function from the `sklearn.metrics` library to obtain the results.

**7. Visualize the Clustering Results:** Use the `seaborn` library or other visualization tools to display the results.

**8. Conclusion:** Use Jupyter Notebook or another platform to write textual conclusions and analyze the results.

## Hints

- Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed using `pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn`.

- Refer to the documentation of `sklearn`, `seaborn`, and `pandas` for additional guidance.

- Experiment with different parameters in spectral clustering to observe their impact on the results.
