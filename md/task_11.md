# Topic 11. Heuristic Optimization Methods. Genetic Algorithms

**Today, you will use your knowledge of genetic algorithms to solve the knapsack problem in the variant discussed in the lecture notes.**

This will help you strengthen the following skills:

- Preparing data for modeling.

- Working with the `PyGad` library.

***
**Task (Step by Step)**

We will use data about 14 items from the example in the lecture notes.

To complete the task, follow these steps:

**1. Install the PyGad library:**

- Use the following command to install the library:

```python
Copy
!pip install pygad
```

**2. Define the fitness function in the code:**

- Implement the fitness function that evaluates the quality of a solution based on the knapsack problem constraints.

**3. Define the initial population:**

- Create an initial population of candidate solutions (chromosomes).

**4. Set the parameters of the genetic algorithm:**

- Specify the number of generations, the number of parent chromosomes involved in crossover, the type of crossover, the type of mutation, and other parameters.

**5. Create an instance of the genetic algorithm using PyGad:**

- Use the `PyGad` library to initialize and configure the genetic algorithm.

**6. Investigate the impact of different crossover and mutation methods on the results:**

- Experiment with different crossover and mutation techniques to observe their effects on the solution quality.

**7. Draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm and the optimal set of parameters:**

- Analyze the results and determine the most effective combination of parameters for solving the knapsack problem.
