# Topic 9. Stochastic Processes and Their Applications in Data Analysis

**Today, you will use the knowledge gained about Markov chains and Markov decision processes to solve a reinforcement learning problem.**

This will help you strengthen the following skills:

- Understanding the elements of Markov chains.

- Grasping the basic concepts of reinforcement learning.

***

**Task (Step by Step)**

For this task, you will need to load the FrozenLake-v1 environment from the OpenAI Gym library.

To complete the task, follow these steps:

**1. Load the environment:**

- Use `gym.make('FrozenLake-v1')` to load the FrozenLake environment.

**2. Implement the `compute_value_function()` function:**

- Using the description of the `compute_value_function()` function provided in the lecture notes under the Policy Iteration section, program its full implementation.

**3. Implement the `policy_iteration()` function:**

Using the description of the `policy_iteration()` function provided in the lecture notes under the Policy Iteration section, program its full implementation.

**4. Visualize the obtained optimal policy:**

Use the `show_render()` function from the lecture notes to visualize the optimal policy.

***
# Hints

- Use functions and algorithms from the lecture notes for this topic.

- Refer to the documentation of `gym` and other relevant libraries for additional guidance.
