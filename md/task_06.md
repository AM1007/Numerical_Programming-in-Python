# Topic 6. Series and Fourier Analysis in Mathematics

**Today, you will apply the Fourier transform to build spectrograms of audio signals, which is a preparatory step for classification. You will use the ESC-50 dataset to determine spectrograms and further cluster observations to identify sounds of similar origin.**

This will help you strengthen the following skills:

- Computing the Fourier transform.

- Applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in audio processing to generate features that can be used for clustering or classification.

# Task (Step by Step)

For this task, you will need to download the ESC-50 dataset, as described in the lecture notes.

To complete the task, follow these steps:

**1. Reduce the dataset size:**

- Create a sample of sounds with the labels 'dog' and 'chirping_birds'.

**2. Generate the spectrogram matrix:**

- Use the `spectrogram` function provided in the lecture notes to generate the spectrogram matrix.

**3. Apply pooling:**

- Use the `pooling` function to generalize and reduce the size of the spectrogram.

**4. Flatten the spectrogram matrix:**

- Use the `flatten()` method to transform the spectrogram matrix into a vector for further spectral analysis.

**5. Perform spectral clustering:**

Use the `SpectralClustering` function from the `sklearn` library to cluster the obtained data (similar to Homework Topic #1).

**6. Analyze the resulting clusters:**

Did sounds of different origins end up in different clusters?

**7. Draw conclusions:**

Summarize the significance of using the Fourier transform for feature extraction in data analysis.
